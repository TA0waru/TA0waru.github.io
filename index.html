    <h3>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h3>
   
    <p>In CSS, classes and ID selectors are used to identify various HTML elements.
      ID selectors has the highest priority because of unique nature of the ID attribute definition.
      ID selector will apply font-size and font-weigth. With CSS, there are no specific reasons forcing you to use an ID over a class.
      Only use IDs if you want a Style to apply to one element on the web page.
