        <h2>1. What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          At first, joining Dev Academy was my choice to slowly pick up skills
          and develop a routine for successful and new life changes. To date, it
          hasn't been slow and there has been a new skill that I haven't even
          heard about for every hour of Learning Journey. It has been an
          essential need for me to get away from the act of full-time labor.
          Although I sometimes really enjoy the aspects of comradery and moving
          fast in searching for goals in the workplace, there have been moments
          where I do show some concerns for a better way to reach an option for
          a work and life balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I would like to educate myself to reach to become a business owner.
          The career pathway would have to be in a space where people can
          connect with mentors to develop the need to assist within the
          community with youth development and at-risk youth. I'm still looking
          through my own personal strengths and weaknesses to understand when I
          can be stable and better way to achieve my goals through learning.
        </p>

        <h2>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning.
        </h2>
        <p>
          My current methodical approach to this learning environment has not
          been as good as I thought it would be. I have been learning more about
          practical solutions because I am more of a hands-on learner. There
          have been moments where I do admit to myself that I am too whakama to
          speak up which is really tricky for me. The pace of learning this
          digital info is something that questions everything. My skill, the how
          to’s, remembering how to repeat the task again, just to mention a few.
          The space I personally feel the most distracted by are my own personal
          worries. I feel more at ease once I have more clarity for these
          matters to settle to get ahead to focus on the mahi.
        </p>

        <h2>
          3, What skills (non-technical core/human) would you like to see
          develop in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          This ability to be more punctual with tasking and time management is
          always been a winning skill in the past. I would to develop a
          thoughtful approach to be better with my time and learning. Learning
          basic functions and the application of knowledge to create a really
          successful project completed would be the bombs.
        </p>

        <h2>
          4, A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this program.
          This should include:
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am caught in a web of confusion with the instructions on many of the
          kaupapa. I find that having Korero does help but my confidence in
          learning to be autonomous is the part is a labyrinth I am needing
          guidance with. My management with leaving things for a moment and
          composing myself is something that I have to mention as something I am
          yet to discover to a satisfactory level of my own personal standard.
        </p>
        <h2>
          5, A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way.
        </h2>
        <p>
          This question gets me in a lot of different ways. At this stage of my
          learning, I have found that having the mental dexterity to sit and
          read is definitely within reach within reach of my own goals. At his
          part is the trick. I believe that I do shy away from seeking help
          because well, I am simply not accustomed to asking for any help; and
          realizing this fact in knowing that this habit does not serve me well.
        </p>

        <h2>6, A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
        <p>
          The only facilitator I have spoken to is our own group facilitator. As
          this may come strange to some, the way I would like to communicate has
          been something that I am coming into. I expect to be treated with a
          degree of patience and develop a proper manner of communication in a
          way that is acceptable with this brilliant kaupapa and mahi.
        </p>

        <h2>
          7, Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Well, this is a biggie because I'm dealing with a few personal things
          for my own personal goals, growth, and development. I must find time
          to schedule just to drop the burden of worry. I have a legal situation
          that sometimes makes me anxyz about it. I would like to invest more in
          my health and expand my understanding of financial literacy. Seeking
          assistance or finding out about these things has made me whakamaa to
          understand more and plan ahead.
