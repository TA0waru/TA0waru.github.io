        <p>
          At first, joining Dev Academy was my choice to slowly pick up skills
          and develop a routine for successful and new life changes. To date, it
          hasn't been slow and there has been a new skill that I haven't even
          heard about for every hour of Learning Journey. It has been an
          essential need for me to get away from the act of full-time labor.
          Although I sometimes really enjoy the aspects of comradery and moving
          fast in searching for goals in the workplace, there have been moments
          where I do show some concerns for a better way to reach an option for
          a work and life balance.

          would like to educate myself to reach to become a business owner. The
          career pathway would have to be in a space where people can connect
          with mentors to develop the need to assist within the community with
          youth development and at-risk youth. I'm still looking through my own
          personal strengths and weaknesses to understand when I can be stable
          and better way to achieve my goals through learning. You can see an
          example of this <a href="www.cats.com">here</a>
