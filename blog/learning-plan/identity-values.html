        <p>
          would like to educate myself to reach to become a business owner. The
          career pathway would have to be in a space where people can connect
          with mentors to develop the need to assist within the community with
          youth development and at-risk youth. I'm still looking through my own
          personal strengths and weaknesses to understand when I can be stable
          and better way to achieve my goals through learning. You can see an
          example of this <a href="www.cats.com">here</a>
