          There are times that I have been Bizzy in my day-to-day routine. I
          have spent extra time to help and assist with sharing whakaaro and
          discovering small goals to benefit self-improvement.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are moments where the feeling of help and tautoko is needed.
          This has impacted my life goals in good ways and has also not been
          something that has assisted in my own way of living. I understand that
          losing the time for my own work does interior with my own way of
          working.

          2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.

        <p>
          The people I look up to are accomplished a doing well in their own
          careers. The ability to inform others and network in the act of being
          a professional is more than cool. These inspire me to work this
          pathway to see what I can do to give back.

          3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.

          This will determine a new definition of grit. In order for me to
          succeed, there will be a great deal to manage my time in accordance
          with the task at hand and the personal side of my life as this journey
          unfolds. How I approach the professionals to conduct my own personal
          affairs is the key to the timing I must apply to better suit these
          circumstances. The way I understand the instructions in the workbook
          will develop to achieve goals in a timely fashion. I am yet to
          understand these parts as they are new but through the cohort and
          Facilitators, once I can picture what is expected (in small doses) I
          can apply this to improve my learning.

          5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h2>

        <p>
          In a working team environment. On many occasions, a new or
          inexperienced person may be uncomfortable with asking questions,
          directions, and or instructions. This may cause an individual or a
          group to be complacent and disorganized. The application of the
          correct procedures, a method to suit the group, or a better
          understanding of the skills and techniques. Just to add, the sequence
          to flow through the workload has a beneficial change in the people
          assisting each other. Guiding new people in a patient and with the
          correct use of wording to apply to each new learning situation
          increases the confidence of such individuals to work as a whole.
